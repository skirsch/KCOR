## Overview

KCOR (Kirsch Cumulative Outcomes Ratio) is a robust statistical methodology for analyzing relative mortality risk between different vaccination groups while accounting for underlying mortality rate time trend differences. This repository contains the complete analysis pipeline for computing KCOR values from mortality data.

Suppose you could take any two cohorts, regardless of age, sex, frailty mix, etc. and normalize the mortality rate so that if there is no external signal applied that might differentially impact their mortality, both cohorts would die over time with identical mortality rates.

That‚Äôs what KCOR does. Once the cohorts are precisely matched from a mortality rate point of view, we can simply cumulate the adjusted hazards and see which cohort had more deaths.

KCOR basically allows you to run a randomized trial with respect to the death outcome, using observational data.

KCOR allows us, for the first time, to objectively answer very important societal questions such as, ‚ÄúDid the COVID vaccine kill more people than it saved?‚Äù

## üî¨ Methodology

### üéØ Core Concept

KCOR represents the ratio of cumulative hazard functions between two groups (e.g., vaccinated vs. unvaccinated), normalized to 1 at a baseline period. This approach provides interpretable estimates of relative mortality risk that account for:

- **Time-varying trends** in mortality rates through slope correction
- **Mathematical exactness** through discrete hazard function transformation
- **Baseline differences** between groups through normalization
- **Statistical uncertainty** in the estimates through proper variance propagation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Pipeline

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Enrollment Date Filtering**: Data processing starts from the enrollment date derived from sheet names (e.g., "2021_24" = 2021, week 24)
- **Sex Aggregation**: Mortality data is aggregated across sexes for each (YearOfBirth, Dose, DateDied) combination
- **Smoothing**: 8-week centered moving average applied to raw mortality rates to reduce noise

#### 2. Slope Calculation (Lookup Table Method)
- **Anchor Points**: Uses predefined time points (e.g., weeks 53 and 114 from enrollment for 2021_24)
- **Window Approach**: For each anchor point, creates a ¬±2 week window (5 points total)
- **Geometric Mean**: Calculates geometric mean of smoothed MR values within each window

**Slope Formula:**

$$r = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \ln\left(\frac{\tilde{B}}{\tilde{A}}\right)$$

Where:
- **√É** = Geometric mean of MR values in window around first anchor: $$\tilde{A} = \text{GM}(MR_{t \in [t_0-w, t_0+w]})$$
- **BÃÉ** = Geometric mean of MR values in window around second anchor: $$\tilde{B} = \text{GM}(MR_{t \in [t_1-w, t_1+w]})$$
- **Œît** = Time difference between anchor points (in weeks)
- **w** = Window size (default: 2 weeks)

**Geometric Mean Calculation:**

$$\text{GM}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = e^{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln(x_i)}$$

- **Consistency**: Same anchor points used for all doses to ensure comparability
- **Quiet Periods**: Anchor dates chosen during periods with minimal differential events (COVID waves, policy changes, etc.)

#### 3. Mortality Rate Adjustment
- **Exponential Slope Removal**: `MR_adj = MR √ó e^{-slope √ó (t - t0)}`
- **Baseline Normalization**: t0 = baseline week (typically week 4) where KCOR is normalized to 1
- **Dose-Specific Slopes**: Each dose-age combination gets its own slope for adjustment

#### 4. KCOR Computation (Enhanced v4.1)
**Three-Step Process:**

1. **Individual MR Adjustment**: Apply slope correction to each mortality rate
2. **Hazard Transform**: Convert adjusted mortality rates to discrete hazard functions for mathematical exactness  
3. **Cumulative Hazard**: Compute CMR as cumulative sum of hazard functions
4. **Ratio Calculation**: Compute KCOR as ratio of cumulative hazards, normalized to baseline

**Step 1: Mortality Rate Adjustment**

$$\text{MR}_{\text{adj}}(t) = \text{MR}(t) \times e^{-r(t - t_0)}$$

**Step 2: Discrete Hazard Function Transform**

$$\text{hazard}(t) = -\ln(1 - \text{MR}_{\text{adj}}(t))$$

Where MR_adj is clipped to 0.999 to avoid log(0).

**Step 3: Cumulative Hazard (CMR)**

$$\text{CMR}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{t} \text{hazard}(i)$$

**Step 4: KCOR as Hazard Ratio**

**KCOR Formula:**

$$\text{KCOR}(t) = \frac{\text{CMR}_v(t) / \text{CMR}_u(t)}{\text{CMR}_v(t_0) / \text{CMR}_u(t_0)}$$

Where:
- **r** = Calculated slope for the specific dose-age combination
- **MR(t)** = Raw mortality rate at time t
- **t‚ÇÄ** = Baseline time for normalization (typically week 4)
- **CMR(t)** = Cumulative hazard at time t (sum of discrete hazards)
- **Mathematical Enhancement**: Discrete cumulative-hazard transform provides more exact CMR calculation than simple summation
- **Interpretation**: KCOR = 1 at baseline, showing relative risk evolution over time

#### 5. Uncertainty Quantification
**95% Confidence Interval Calculation:**

The variance of KCOR is calculated using proper uncertainty propagation for the hazard ratio:

$$\text{Var}[\ln(\text{KCOR}(t))] = \frac{\text{Var}[\text{CMR}_v(t)]}{\text{CMR}_v(t)^2} + \frac{\text{Var}[\text{CMR}_u(t)]}{\text{CMR}_u(t)^2} + \frac{\text{Var}[\text{CMR}_v(t_0)]}{\text{CMR}_v(t_0)^2} + \frac{\text{Var}[\text{CMR}_u(t_0)]}{\text{CMR}_u(t_0)^2}$$

**Confidence Interval Bounds:**

$$\text{CI}_{\text{lower}}(t) = \text{KCOR}(t) \times e^{-1.96 \sqrt{\text{Var}[\ln(\text{KCOR}(t))]}}$$

$$\text{CI}_{\text{upper}}(t) = \text{KCOR}(t) \times e^{1.96 \sqrt{\text{Var}[\ln(\text{KCOR}(t))]}}$$

Where:
- **Var[CMR] ‚âà CMR**: Using Poisson variance approximation for cumulative hazard (sum of hazards)
- **Var[ln(KCOR)]**: Variance on log scale for proper uncertainty propagation of hazard ratio
- **1.96**: 95% confidence level multiplier (standard normal distribution)
- **Log-Scale Calculation**: CI bounds calculated on log scale then exponentiated for proper asymmetry

#### 6. Age Standardization
**ASMR Pooling Formula:**

The age-standardized KCOR is calculated using fixed baseline weights:

$$\text{KCOR}_{\text{ASMR}}(t) = e^{\frac{\sum_i w_i \ln(\text{KCOR}_i(t))}{\sum_i w_i}}$$

Where:
- **w·µ¢** = Fixed weight for age group i (person-time in first 4 weeks)
- **KCOR·µ¢(t)** = KCOR value for age group i at time t
- **ln(KCOR·µ¢(t))** = Natural logarithm of KCOR for age group i

**Weight Calculation:**

$$w_i = \sum_{t=t_0}^{t_0+3} \text{PT}_i(t)$$

Where:
- **PT·µ¢(t)** = Person-time for age group i at week t
- **t‚ÇÄ** = Baseline week (typically week 4)
- **t‚ÇÄ+3** = Three weeks after baseline

- **Fixed Weights**: Weights based on person-time in first 4 weeks per age group (time-invariant)
- **Population Estimates**: Provides population-level KCOR estimates

### Key Assumptions

- Mortality rates follow exponential trends during the observation period
- No differential events affect dose groups differently during anchor periods
- Baseline period (week 4) represents "normal" conditions
- Person-time = Alive (survivor function approximation)
- Discrete hazard function transformation provides accurate cumulative hazard estimation
- Hazard ratios are appropriate for comparing mortality risk between groups

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Key Parameters

```python
# Core methodology
ANCHOR_WEEKS = 4                    # Baseline week for KCOR normalization
SLOPE_WINDOW_SIZE = 2               # Window size for slope calculation (¬±2 weeks)
MA_TOTAL_LENGTH = 8                 # Moving average length (8 weeks)
CENTERED = True                     # Use centered moving average

# Data quality limits
MAX_DATE_FOR_SLOPE = "2024-04-01"  # Maximum date for slope calculation

# Analysis scope
YEAR_RANGE = (1920, 2000)          # Birth year range to process
DEBUG_SHEET_ONLY = ["2021_24", "2022_06"]  # Sheets to process
```

### Sheet-Specific Configuration

The script automatically determines dose pairs based on sheet names:

- **2021_24**: Doses 0, 1, 2 ‚Üí Comparisons: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)
- **2022_06**: Doses 0, 1, 2, 3 ‚Üí Comparisons: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,2), (3,0)

## üìä Interpretation

### KCOR Values

- **KCOR = 1.0**: No difference in mortality risk between groups
- **KCOR > 1.0**: Higher mortality risk in numerator group (e.g., vaccinated)
- **KCOR < 1.0**: Lower mortality risk in numerator group
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provide statistical uncertainty around the point estimate

### Example Output

```
Dose combination: 2 vs 0
--------------------------------------------------
            YoB | KCOR [95% CI]
--------------------------------------------------
  ASMR (pooled) | 1.3050 [1.032, 1.650]
           1940 | 1.2607 [1.124, 1.414]
           1955 | 1.5026 [1.229, 1.837]
```

This shows that for dose 2 vs. dose 0:
- **ASMR**: 30.5% higher mortality risk (95% CI: 3.2% to 65.0%)
- **Age 1940**: 26.1% higher risk (95% CI: 12.4% to 41.4%)
- **Age 1955**: 50.3% higher risk (95% CI: 22.9% to 83.7%)
