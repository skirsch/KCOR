## Overview

KCOR (Kirsch Cumulative Outcomes Ratio) is a robust statistical methodology for analyzing relative mortality risk between different vaccination groups while accounting for underlying time trends. This repository contains the complete analysis pipeline for computing KCOR values from mortality data.

Suppose you could take any two cohorts, regardless of age, sex, frailty mix, and normalize the mortality rate so that if there is no external signal applied that might differentially impact their mortality, both cohorts would die over time with identical death rates.

That‚Äôs what KCOR does. Once the cohorts are precisely matched from a mortality point of view, we simply count the total deaths over time in each cohort and see which cohort had more deaths.

KCOR basically allows you to run a randomized trial with respect to the death outcome, using observational data.

KCOR allows us, for the first time, to objectively answer very important societal questions such as, ‚ÄúDid the COVID vaccine kill more people than it saved?‚Äù

## üî¨ Methodology

### üéØ Core Concept

KCOR represents the ratio of cumulative mortality rates between two groups (e.g., vaccinated vs. unvaccinated), normalized to 1 at a baseline period. This approach provides interpretable estimates of relative mortality risk that account for:

- **Time-varying trends** in mortality rates
- **Baseline differences** between groups
- **Statistical uncertainty** in the estimates

### ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Pipeline

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Enrollment Date Filtering**: Data processing starts from the enrollment date derived from sheet names (e.g., "2021_24" = 2021, week 24)
- **Sex Aggregation**: Mortality data is aggregated across sexes for each (YearOfBirth, Dose, DateDied) combination
- **Smoothing**: 8-week centered moving average applied to raw mortality rates to reduce noise

#### 2. Slope Calculation (Lookup Table Method)
- **Anchor Points**: Uses predefined time points (e.g., weeks 53 and 114 from enrollment for 2021_24)
- **Window Approach**: For each anchor point, creates a ¬±2 week window (5 points total)
- **Geometric Mean**: Calculates geometric mean of smoothed MR values within each window

**Slope Formula:**

$$r = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \ln\left(\frac{\tilde{B}}{\tilde{A}}\right)$$

Where:
- **√É** = Geometric mean of MR values in window around first anchor: $$\tilde{A} = \text{GM}(MR_{t \in [t_0-w, t_0+w]})$$
- **BÃÉ** = Geometric mean of MR values in window around second anchor: $$\tilde{B} = \text{GM}(MR_{t \in [t_1-w, t_1+w]})$$
- **Œît** = Time difference between anchor points (in weeks)
- **w** = Window size (default: 2 weeks)

**Geometric Mean Calculation:**

$$\text{GM}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = e^{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln(x_i)}$$

- **Consistency**: Same anchor points used for all doses to ensure comparability
- **Quiet Periods**: Anchor dates chosen during periods with minimal differential events (COVID waves, policy changes, etc.)

#### 3. Mortality Rate Adjustment
- **Exponential Slope Removal**: `MR_adj = MR √ó e^{-slope √ó (t - t0)}`
- **Baseline Normalization**: t0 = baseline week (typically week 4) where KCOR is normalized to 1
- **Dose-Specific Slopes**: Each dose-age combination gets its own slope for adjustment

#### 4. KCOR Computation
**KCOR Formula:**

$$\text{KCOR}(t) = \frac{\text{CMR}_v(t) / \text{CMR}_u(t)}  {\text{CMR}_v(t_0) / \text{CMR}_u(t_0)}$$

Where:
- **CMR(t)** = Cumulative adjusted mortality rate at time t:

$$\text{CMR}(t) = \frac{\text{cumD}_{\text{adj}}(t)}{\text{cumPT}(t)}$$

- **t‚ÇÄ** = Baseline time (typically week 4) where KCOR is normalized to 1
- **cumD_adj(t)** = Cumulative adjusted deaths up to time t
- **cumPT(t)** = Cumulative person-time up to time t

**Mortality Rate Adjustment:**

$$\text{MR}_{\text{adj}}(t) = \text{MR}(t) \times e^{-r(t - t_0)}$$

Where:
- **r** = Calculated slope for the specific dose-age combination
- **MR(t)** = Raw mortality rate at time t
- **t‚ÇÄ** = Baseline time for normalization
- **Baseline Reference**: Baseline values taken at week 4 (or first available week)
- **Interpretation**: KCOR = 1 at baseline, showing relative risk evolution over time

#### 5. Uncertainty Quantification
**95% Confidence Interval Calculation:**

The variance of KCOR is calculated using proper uncertainty propagation:

$$\text{Var}[\text{KCOR}(t)] = \text{KCOR}(t)^2 \times \left[\frac{\text{Var}[\text{cumD}_v(t)]}{\text{cumD}_v(t)^2} + \frac{\text{Var}[\text{cumD}_u(t)]}{\text{cumD}_u(t)^2} + \frac{\text{Var}[\text{cumD}_v(t_0)]}{\text{cumD}_v(t_0)^2} + \frac{\text{Var}[\text{cumD}_u(t_0)]}{\text{cumD}_u(t_0)^2}\right]$$

**Confidence Interval Bounds:**

$$\text{CI}_{\text{lower}}(t) = \text{KCOR}(t) \times e^{-1.96 \sqrt{\text{Var}[\ln(\text{KCOR}(t))]}}$$

$$\text{CI}_{\text{upper}}(t) = \text{KCOR}(t) \times e^{1.96 \sqrt{\text{Var}[\ln(\text{KCOR}(t))]}}$$

Where:
- **Var[D] ‚âà D**: Using binomial variance approximation for death counts
- **Var[ln(KCOR)]**: Variance on log scale for proper uncertainty propagation
- **1.96**: 95% confidence level multiplier (standard normal distribution)
- **Log-Scale Calculation**: CI bounds calculated on log scale then exponentiated for proper asymmetry

#### 6. Age Standardization
**ASMR Pooling Formula:**

The age-standardized KCOR is calculated using fixed baseline weights:

$$\text{KCOR}_{\text{ASMR}}(t) = e^{\frac{\sum_i w_i \ln(\text{KCOR}_i(t))}{\sum_i w_i}}$$

Where:
- **w·µ¢** = Fixed weight for age group i (person-time in first 4 weeks)
- **KCOR·µ¢(t)** = KCOR value for age group i at time t
- **ln(KCOR·µ¢(t))** = Natural logarithm of KCOR for age group i

**Weight Calculation:**

$$w_i = \sum_{t=t_0}^{t_0+3} \text{PT}_i(t)$$

Where:
- **PT·µ¢(t)** = Person-time for age group i at week t
- **t‚ÇÄ** = Baseline week (typically week 4)
- **t‚ÇÄ+3** = Three weeks after baseline

- **Fixed Weights**: Weights based on person-time in first 4 weeks per age group (time-invariant)
- **Population Estimates**: Provides population-level KCOR estimates

### Key Assumptions

- Mortality rates follow exponential trends during the observation period
- No differential events affect dose groups differently during anchor periods
- Baseline period (week 4) represents "normal" conditions
- Person-time = Alive (survivor function approximation)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Key Parameters

```python
# Core methodology
ANCHOR_WEEKS = 4                    # Baseline week for KCOR normalization
SLOPE_WINDOW_SIZE = 2               # Window size for slope calculation (¬±2 weeks)
MA_TOTAL_LENGTH = 8                 # Moving average length (8 weeks)
CENTERED = True                     # Use centered moving average

# Data quality limits
MAX_DATE_FOR_SLOPE = "2024-04-01"  # Maximum date for slope calculation

# Analysis scope
YEAR_RANGE = (1920, 2000)          # Birth year range to process
DEBUG_SHEET_ONLY = ["2021_24", "2022_06"]  # Sheets to process
```

### Sheet-Specific Configuration

The script automatically determines dose pairs based on sheet names:

- **2021_24**: Doses 0, 1, 2 ‚Üí Comparisons: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)
- **2022_06**: Doses 0, 1, 2, 3 ‚Üí Comparisons: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,2), (3,0)

## üìä Interpretation

### KCOR Values

- **KCOR = 1.0**: No difference in mortality risk between groups
- **KCOR > 1.0**: Higher mortality risk in numerator group (e.g., vaccinated)
- **KCOR < 1.0**: Lower mortality risk in numerator group
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provide statistical uncertainty around the point estimate

### Example Output

```
Dose combination: 2 vs 0
--------------------------------------------------
  ASMR (pooled)   | KCOR [95% CI]:   1.3050 [1.032, 1.650]
  Age 1940        | KCOR [95% CI]:   1.2607 [1.124, 1.414]
  Age 1955        | KCOR [95% CI]:   1.5026 [1.229, 1.837]
```

This shows that for dose 2 vs. dose 0:
- **ASMR**: 30.5% higher mortality risk (95% CI: 3.2% to 65.0%)
- **Age 1940**: 26.1% higher risk (95% CI: 12.4% to 41.4%)
- **Age 1955**: 50.3% higher risk (95% CI: 22.9% to 83.7%)

## üîß Advanced Features

### Moving Average Smoothing
- **8-week centered MA**: Reduces noise while preserving trend information
- **Configurable**: Window size and centering can be adjusted
- **Pre-slope**: Applied before slope calculation for stability

### Window-Based Slope Estimation
- **Robust Anchoring**: Uses multiple time points around each anchor
- **Geometric Mean**: Appropriate for multiplicative processes like mortality
- **Consistent Comparison**: Same anchor points across all dose groups

### Confidence Interval Calculation
- **Proper Propagation**: Accounts for uncertainty in both baseline and current estimates
- **Asymmetric Bounds**: Reflects the non-symmetric nature of ratio estimates
- **Binomial Variance**: Appropriate for count data

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Data**: Ensure all required columns are present in input files
2. **Date Formats**: Verify dates are in proper datetime format
3. **Memory Issues**: Large datasets may require processing in smaller chunks
4. **Slope Calculation**: Check that anchor points fall within available data range

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed debugging by setting:
```python
DEBUG_VERBOSE = True
DEBUG_SHEET_ONLY = ["sheet_name"]  # Limit to specific sheets
YEAR_RANGE = (1940, 1945)          # Limit to specific age range
```

That is, if I'm lucky enough to get this published. It's ground breaking, but people seem uninterested in methods that expose the truth about the COVID vaccines for some reason.

## Output when used on the Czech data
There was no combination of dose and age where there was a statistically significant benefit. It was pretty much all statistically significant harm. All the CI's had a high CI that was >1. See the [log file](https://analysis/KCOR_console_summary.log) for the full data.
