Frailty shifts the Gompertz curve left.

A fixed cohort, of a given frailty, will die off sooner. The frailty remains CONSTANT for the cohort.

Frailty is always relative to a point in time, e.g., a 70 year old cohort with frailty 3, dies off at a certain rate over time.

It is harder to find more frail cohorts at older age because the frail die off faster, so the frailty ratio (e.g., static HVE differences) are smaller.

You can measure frailty by measuring the ACM differences of cohorts at that point in time.

So a 70 year old cohort with frailty 3 dies off at a certain rate over time. It will give the appearance of frailty=2 at 80 years old. So you can model the SAME cohort assuming frailty 2 at 80, OR you can model it as frailty 3 at 70. They give the same results after 80.
