This approach is less vulnerable than the Cox model to problems of inconsistency when covariates are deleted or the precision of covariate measurements is changed. A method of non-parametric estimation of regression functions is presented. This results in plots that may give information on the change over time in the influence of covariates. A test method and two goodness of fit plots are also given. The approach is illustrated by simulation as well as by data from a clinical trial of treatment of carcinoma of the oropharynx.},

  abstract = {Observational studies on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) have provided critical real-world data, informing public health policy globally. These studies, primarily using pre-existing data sources, have been indispensable in assessing VE across diverse populations and developing sustainable vaccination strategies. Cohort design is frequently employed in VE research. The rapid implementation of vaccination campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic introduced differential vaccination influenced by sociodemographic disparities, public policies, perceived risks, health-promoting behaviors, and health status, potentially resulting in biases such as healthy user bias, healthy vaccinee effect, frailty bias, differential depletion of susceptibility bias, and confounding by indication. The overwhelming burden on healthcare systems has escalated the risk of data inaccuracies, leading to outcome misclassifications. Additionally, the extensive array of diagnostic tests used during the pandemic has also contributed to misclassification biases. The urgency to publish quickly may have further influenced these biases or led to their oversight, affecting the validity of the findings. These biases in studies vary considerably depending on the setting, data sources, and analytical methods and are likely more pronounced in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings due to inadequate data infrastructure. Addressing and mitigating these biases is essential for accurate VE estimates, guiding public health strategies, and sustaining public trust in vaccination programs. Transparent communication about these biases and rigorous improvement in the design of future observational studies are essential.},

  abstract = {We analyze a large Dutch national observational mortality and Covid-19 vaccination cohort with the goal of (re)assessing real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE), comparing against earlier work based on the same dataset that reported very high positive effectiveness and safety. We use standard epidemiological survival analyses combined with stratification and matching based on multiple available population and health indicators to correct for confounding. We also perform complementary, calendar time-based analyses using diverse population and health-related data, as well as epidemiological sanity checks related to negative controls and data integrity. In all analyses, we primarily focus on all-cause mortality (ACM) effects, and on identifying potential biases and artifacts. Our results and supporting evidence strongly suggest two large statistical artifacts: residual healthy vaccinee bias (despite matching) and vaccination status misclassification bias. These lead to unrealistically high mortality among individuals with status unvaccinated during vaccination rounds, which cannot be attributed to Covid-19 prevention, as well as related and longer-term effects. These anomalies have a detrimental and disqualifying effect on both our own calculated VE results and previously reported results based on the same dataset, anomalies that are very hard to correct without additional fine-grained and high-integrity data. The realistic Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness and safety profile is masked by the large artifacts; vaccine protection against ACM appears at best to be considerably lower than previously described, and its true effect is unclear. Finally, we provide suggestions for additional analyses and future research.},

  abstract = {Background:. This study investigated the presence of the healthy vaccinee effect---the imbalance in health status between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals---in two rigorously conducted COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness studies involving primary series and booster vaccinations. It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar. Methods:. Two matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024. Results:. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.64--0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.67--1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first 6 months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95\% CI: 0.27--0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95\% CI: 1.19--1.94). In the first 6 months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95\% CI: 0.20--0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.02--1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9\% (95\% CI: 94.0--97.1) and 34.1\% (95\% CI: --46.4--76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Conclusions:. A pronounced healthy vaccinee effect was observed during the first 6 months following vaccination, despite meticulous cohort matching. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations. Funding:.

  abstract = {Importance               Estimating global lives and life-years saved is important to put into perspective the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, and lack crucial life-year calculations and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty.                                         Objective               To calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 1, 2024.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               This comparative effectiveness study considered different strata of the worldwide population according to age, community-dwelling and long-term care residence status, pre-Omicron and Omicron periods, and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.                                         Exposures               Any COVID-19 vaccination in any schedule and number of doses.                                         Main Outcome Measure               Death.                                         Results               In the main analysis, more than 2.5 million deaths were averted (1 death averted per 5400 vaccine doses administered). Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57\% were during the Omicron period, and 90\% pertained to people 60 years or older. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives were saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed a preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. An estimated 14.8 million life-years were saved (1 life-year saved per 900 vaccine doses administered). The sensitivity range was 7.4 to 23.6 million life-years. Most life-years saved (76\%) were among people 60 years or older, but long-term care residents contributed only 2\% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01\% of lives saved and 0.1\% of life-years saved) and young adults aged 20 through 29 years (0.07\% of lives saved and 0.3\% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit.                                         Conclusions and Relevance               Estimates in this study are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still clearly demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during the years 2020-2024. Most benefits in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of older persons, a minority of the global population.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Determine age-specific infection fatality rates for COVID-19 to inform public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups. Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4~weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002\% at age 10 and 0.01\% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4\% at age 55, 1.4\% at age 65, 4.6\% at age 75, and 15\% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90\% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.},

However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer. Copyright \copyright{} 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Using this approach, simple proportional hazards models are able to catch the development over time for models with time-varying effects of covariates or data with time-dependent covariates (biomarkers).

The results imply that standard methods overestimate current life expectancy and potential gains in life expectancy from health and safety interventions, while underestimating rates of individual aging, past progress in reducing mortality, and mortality differentials between pairs of populations. Calculations based on Swedish mortality data suggest that these errors may be important, especially in old age.},
