  abstract = {Background:. This study investigated the presence of the healthy vaccinee effect---the imbalance in health status between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals---in two rigorously conducted COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness studies involving primary series and booster vaccinations. It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar. Methods:. Two matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024. Results:. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.64--0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.67--1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first 6 months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95\% CI: 0.27--0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95\% CI: 1.19--1.94). In the first 6 months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95\% CI: 0.20--0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.02--1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9\% (95\% CI: 94.0--97.1) and 34.1\% (95\% CI: --46.4--76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Conclusions:. A pronounced healthy vaccinee effect was observed during the first 6 months following vaccination, despite meticulous cohort matching. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations. Funding:.

  abstract = {Importance               Estimating global lives and life-years saved is important to put into perspective the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, and lack crucial life-year calculations and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty.                                         Objective               To calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 1, 2024.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               This comparative effectiveness study considered different strata of the worldwide population according to age, community-dwelling and long-term care residence status, pre-Omicron and Omicron periods, and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.                                         Exposures               Any COVID-19 vaccination in any schedule and number of doses.                                         Main Outcome Measure               Death.                                         Results               In the main analysis, more than 2.5 million deaths were averted (1 death averted per 5400 vaccine doses administered). Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57\% were during the Omicron period, and 90\% pertained to people 60 years or older. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives were saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed a preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. An estimated 14.8 million life-years were saved (1 life-year saved per 900 vaccine doses administered). The sensitivity range was 7.4 to 23.6 million life-years. Most life-years saved (76\%) were among people 60 years or older, but long-term care residents contributed only 2\% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01\% of lives saved and 0.1\% of life-years saved) and young adults aged 20 through 29 years (0.07\% of lives saved and 0.3\% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit.                                         Conclusions and Relevance               Estimates in this study are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still clearly demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during the years 2020-2024. Most benefits in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of older persons, a minority of the global population.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Life table methods are developed for populations whose members differ in their endowment for longevity. Unlike standard methods, which ignore such heterogeneity, these methods use different calculations to construct cohort, period, and individual life tables. The results imply that standard methods overestimate current life expectancy and potential gains in life expectancy from health and safety interventions, while underestimating rates of individual aging, past progress in reducing mortality, and mortality differentials between pairs of populations. Calculations based on Swedish mortality data suggest that these errors may be important, especially in old age.},
