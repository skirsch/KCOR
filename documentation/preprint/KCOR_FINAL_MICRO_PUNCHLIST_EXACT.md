# KCOR – Final Micro Punchlist (Exact Text Additions)

This punchlist contains **only high-confidence, low-risk edits** with **exact copy-paste text**.
All items improve clarity and reviewer-proofing without expanding scope or adding new analysis.

---

## 1. Clarify concavity direction (definition-level fix)

**Location:** §1.2 (first discussion of cumulative hazard curvature)

**Replace / augment phrase:**
> “concavity in observed cumulative hazards”

**With:**
> “negative concavity (downward curvature) in observed cumulative hazards”

---

## 2. Define θ_d at first technical encounter (no abstract changes)

**Location (preferred):** Table 2 caption (parameter definitions)

**Exact text to add (one clause):**
> “θ_d denotes the cohort-specific depletion (frailty variance) parameter governing curvature in the observed cumulative hazard.”

**Fallback (if Table 2 caption is unavailable):**
Insert the same sentence at the first occurrence of θ_d in §2.

---

## 3. Discrete-time hazard transform explanation (Eq. 10)

**Location:** Immediately following Eq. 10

**Exact sentence to add:**
> “This form provides a second-order accurate approximation to the continuous-time hazard while remaining numerically stable for small mortality-rate (MR) values.”

No derivation required.

---

## 4. Quantify robustness language in sensitivity analysis (optional but recommended)

**Location:** §3.3 (Sensitivity analysis; Fig. 6 discussion)

**Exact sentence to add:**
> “Across all tested parameter ranges, KCOR values remained within approximately ±5% of unity, indicating stability under reasonable variations in fitting choices.”

Avoid replacing existing text; append this sentence.

---

## 5. Keywords (discoverability polish)

**Location:** Keywords list

**Add keywords:**
- observational studies  
- mortality curvature

Do not add causal or policy-related terms.

---

## Explicitly do NOT change

- Do not add simulations
- Do not add new equations
- Do not expand causal interpretation
- Do not introduce new bias-correction claims
- Do not rename the method

---

## Status after applying this punchlist

- Technical clarity: **maximized**
- Reviewer friction points: **closed**
- Scope integrity: **unchanged**
- Submission readiness: **final**
