Dear Editor,

Please consider this manuscript, *KCOR: A Depletion-Neutralized Cohort Comparison Framework Using Gamma-Frailty Normalization Under Selection-Induced Cumulative Hazard Curvature*, for publication in *Statistics in Medicine*.

This work introduces a normalization principle that addresses a long-standing and largely unrecognized limitation in retrospective survival analysis: real-world cohorts are typically heterogeneous, and selection-induced depletion under latent frailty produces non-proportional hazards that invalidate standard survival estimands when applied directly to observed data. KCOR provides a practical solution to this problem by separating normalization from comparison, thereby enabling meaningful analysis of heterogeneous cohorts commonly encountered in registry and administrative data.

The framework estimates cohort-specific depletion geometry during prespecified epidemiologically quiet periods and applies a gamma-frailty inversion to map observed cumulative hazards into a depletion-neutralized space. Once normalized, cohorts may be compared using standard post-adjustment estimands. In this manuscript, ratios of adjusted cumulative hazards are reported for concreteness and visualization, but the contribution of KCOR lies in restoring a common comparison scale prior to model fitting, rather than in privileging any single estimand.

Through simulation studies spanning a wide range of frailty heterogeneity and selection strength, as well as empirical negative controls, we show that commonly used methods—including Cox proportional hazards regression—can exhibit systematic non-null behavior under selection-only regimes. In contrast, KCOR-normalized trajectories remain stable and centered near the null. The method is intentionally non-causal and is presented as a diagnostic and descriptive framework designed to address bias arising before modeling assumptions are imposed.

We believe this work is well aligned with *Statistics in Medicine*’s focus on foundational methodological contributions that improve the reliability and interpretability of analyses conducted using real-world observational data.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Steve Kirsch
