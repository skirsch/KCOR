Dear Editor,

We submit for your consideration the manuscript “KCOR: Depletion-Neutralized Cohort Comparison via Gamma-Frailty Normalization.” 

The paper introduces a statistical framework for retrospective cohort comparisons in which selection-induced non-proportional hazards arise endogenously from latent frailty heterogeneity and depletion of susceptibles—an issue common in registry and administrative survival data.

The core contribution is a diagnostic-first normalization approach that separates depletion adjustment from outcome comparison. KCOR operates in cumulative-hazard space, using a parsimonious frailty geometry estimated during prespecified epidemiologically quiet periods to place cohorts on a common scale prior to comparison. Rather than improving descriptive fit alone, the framework targets a specific identifiability problem: curvature induced by selection and depletion that persists across flexible hazard models and can generate systematic non-null behavior in conventional estimands. The method enforces observable diagnostics and explicitly signals loss of interpretability when its assumptions are violated.

The manuscript is methodological in scope. Simulations and empirical examples are used to characterize estimator behavior, diagnostics, and failure modes, and to benchmark performance relative to commonly used approaches. The framework is designed for settings with minimal covariate information, where weighting or matching strategies are infeasible or unreliable, and where robustness and interpretability of cohort contrasts are primary concerns rather than causal attribution.

We believe this work will be of interest to Statistics in Medicine readers concerned with non-proportional hazards, selection effects, and the principled interpretation of retrospective cohort analyses.

Sincerely,
Steven T. Kirsch
