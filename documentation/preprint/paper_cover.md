DDear Editor,

We submit for your consideration the manuscript “KCOR: Depletion-Neutralized Cohort Comparison via Gamma-Frailty Normalization,” which introduces a statistical framework for retrospective cohort comparisons affected by selection-induced non-proportional hazards. The paper addresses a recurring failure mode in registry and administrative survival data—latent frailty heterogeneity combined with selective uptake—which induces curvature in cumulative hazards and systematic non-null behavior in commonly used estimands, including Cox proportional hazards regression. KCOR is a methods-focused contribution that separates depletion normalization from outcome comparison, using gamma-frailty geometry estimated during prespecified epidemiologically quiet periods to place cohorts on a common cumulative-hazard scale prior to comparison. The manuscript is methodological in scope; empirical examples and simulations are used solely to demonstrate estimator behavior, diagnostics, and failure modes, with causal interpretation explicitly disclaimed.

The contribution of this work is to provide a diagnostic-first normalization framework for settings in which proportional hazards assumptions fail endogenously due to selection and depletion, and where rich covariate histories are unavailable or unreliable. Existing approaches—flexible hazard models, time-varying coefficients, weighting, or matching—can improve descriptive fit but do not, in general, remove selection-induced depletion geometry prior to defining cohort contrasts. KCOR targets this specific identifiability problem by operating in cumulative-hazard space, enforcing observable diagnostics, and signaling loss of interpretability when assumptions are violated rather than producing silently biased estimates. We believe this framework and its emphasis on diagnostics, estimand clarity, and minimal data requirements will be of interest to Statistics in Medicine readers concerned with the robustness and interpretability of retrospective cohort analyses.

Sincerely,
Steven T. Kirsch
