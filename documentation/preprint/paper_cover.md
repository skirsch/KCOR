**Dear Editor,**

Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled **“KCOR: A Depletion‑Neutralized Framework for Retrospective Cohort Comparison under Latent Frailty.”**

The paper introduces a new statistical framework for retrospective cohort analyses in which selection‑induced non‑proportional hazards arise endogenously from latent frailty heterogeneity and depletion of susceptibles—a pervasive issue in registry and administrative survival data.

**KCOR** provides a _diagnostic‑first normalization_ in cumulative‑hazard space that separates depletion adjustment from outcome comparison. Using a parsimonious gamma‑frailty geometry fitted during pre‑specified epidemiologically quiet periods, the framework places cohorts on a common hazard scale before computing cumulative contrasts. Conceptually, KCOR differs from regression- and matching-based approaches by comparing cohorts on the basis of their aggregated mortality accumulation after depletion normalization, rather than modeling individual-level hazards conditional on survival.

Unlike flexible hazard modeling, KCOR directly targets the identifiability problem created by selection‑induced curvature that can yield systematic non‑null behavior in standard estimands. The method enforces explicit diagnostics and flags loss of interpretability when assumptions are not met.

This is a **methods‑focused manuscript**: simulations and empirical applications characterize estimator performance, diagnostics, and failure modes, and benchmark KCOR against commonly used approaches. It is designed for data environments with minimal covariates—where weighting or matching are infeasible—and where robustness and transparency of cohort comparisons are of primary interest rather than causal attribution.

We believe this work will be of interest to _Statistics in Medicine_ readers concerned with non‑proportional hazards, selection bias, and principled interpretation of real‑world survival analyses.

**Sincerely,**  
Steven T. Kirsch
