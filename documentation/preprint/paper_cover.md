Dear Editor,

Please consider this manuscript, *KCOR: A Depletion-Neutralized Cohort Comparison Framework Using Gamma-Frailty Normalization Under Selection-Induced Cumulative Hazard Curvature*, for publication in *Statistics in Medicine*.

This paper introduces KCOR, a statistical framework for retrospective cohort comparison designed to address selection-induced depletion under latent heterogeneity, a failure mode that limits the interpretability of proportional hazards–based methods in many observational settings, particularly when randomized trials are infeasible and analyses must rely on population registry or administrative data.

The method operates in discrete-time cumulative hazard space, applies a gamma-frailty–based normalization to remove depletion-induced curvature, and yields stable cumulative comparisons without requiring proportional hazards, covariate completeness, or likelihood-based estimation. Simulation studies and an illustrative empirical application are used to demonstrate estimator behavior, diagnostics, and failure modes. The method is non-causal by design and is intended as a descriptive and diagnostic tool for cumulative outcome comparison under selection.

Supplementary material containing additional derivations and supporting analyses is provided as a separate file.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Steve Kirsch
