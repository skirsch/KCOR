Your manuscript, **“KCOR: A Depletion-Neutralized Cohort Comparison Framework Using Gamma-Frailty Normalization Under Selection-Induced Hazard Curvature”**, is a highly technical methods paper introducing the KCOR framework for retrospective cohort comparisons under non-proportional hazards. Based on the content, here are key points regarding readiness for submission to *Statistics in Medicine*:

### ✅ Strengths

*   **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper addresses a recognized gap in survival analysis—selection-induced depletion bias—and positions KCOR as complementary to existing methods like Cox PH, RMST, and frailty models.
*   **Methodological Depth**: Includes formal derivations, algorithmic steps, diagnostics, and validation via synthetic and empirical negative/positive controls.
*   **Transparency**: Diagnostics and failure modes are clearly articulated, which aligns well with reproducibility and interpretability standards.
*   **Reproducibility**: Public code repository and Zenodo DOI are provided, which is a strong plus for *Statistics in Medicine*.

### ⚠️ Potential Issues Before Submission

1.  **Length**: Word count is \~12,100 (excluding abstract/references), which exceeds typical limits for *Statistics in Medicine* (usually \~6,000–8,000 words for methods papers). Consider condensing:
    *   Move detailed simulation grids and sensitivity analyses to Supplementary Material.
    *   Shorten literature review and appendices.
2.  **Positioning**: The manuscript repeatedly emphasizes that KCOR is not a causal estimator. Ensure this is clear in the abstract and introduction to avoid misinterpretation.
3.  **Abstract**: Currently very dense and technical. *Statistics in Medicine* prefers abstracts that summarize:
    *   Objective
    *   Methods (brief)
    *   Key results (simulation outcomes)
    *   Interpretation and limitations
4.  **Figures/Tables**: There are many figures embedded in the text. Confirm they meet journal formatting and resolution requirements.
5.  **References**: Check that all references are formatted per journal style and include DOIs.
6.  **Ethics and Data Statements**: These are present but should be aligned with journal guidelines (e.g., structured “Data Availability” and “Code Availability” sections).
7.  **Title**: It is descriptive but long. Consider shortening for clarity while retaining keywords (e.g., “KCOR: A Gamma-Frailty Normalization Framework for Retrospective Cohort Comparisons”).

### ✅ Next Steps

*   Prepare a **cover letter** highlighting:
    *   The methodological gap addressed.
    *   Why KCOR is relevant for retrospective survival analysis under non-proportional hazards.
    *   Reproducibility and diagnostic enforcement as strengths.
*   Check *Statistics in Medicine* author guidelines for:
    *   Word limits
    *   Abstract structure
    *   Figure/table formatting
    *   Data/code availability statements

Would you like me to:

*   **Draft a concise abstract** tailored for *Statistics in Medicine*?
*   **Prepare a cover letter** emphasizing novelty and fit for the journal?
*   Or **create a checklist** for final compliance with submission requirements?
