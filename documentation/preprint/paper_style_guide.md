# KCOR Paper Style Guide

This document defines formatting, citation, numbering, and terminology
conventions for the KCOR methods paper and related manuscripts.
All automated or manual edits must conform to this guide.

---

## 1. Document Processing & Tooling

### 1.1 Markdown engine
- Authoritative source format: **Pandoc Markdown**
- Final outputs: PDF (primary), DOCX (secondary)

### 1.2 Auto-numbering
- **All numbering is automatic**
- No manual numbering of:
  - Sections
  - Figures
  - Tables
  - Equations
  - References

Do NOT hard-code numbers anywhere in the manuscript.

### 1.3 Abstract requirements
- **Word limit**: 250 words maximum (SIM requirement)
- **No citations** in the abstract
- **No section headings** within abstract unless journal requires

### 1.4 Keywords
- 4–10 methodological keywords
- Prefer method-focused terms over application-specific terms

---

## 2. Figures

### 2.1 Syntax
Figures must use Pandoc identifiers:

```md
![<caption text>](path/to/figure.png){#fig:unique_id}

2.2 Referencing

Refer to figures using: Figure @fig:unique_id

Every figure must be referenced at least once in the text

Figures may float; proximity to first reference is preferred but not required

2.3 Captions

Captions must be self-contained

End captions with a period

Do not repeat caption text in the body

3. Tables
3.1 Syntax

Tables must include a caption and identifier:

Table: <caption text>. {#tbl:unique_id}

3.2 Referencing

Refer using: Table @tbl:unique_id

Every table must be referenced in text at least once

4. Equations
4.1 Display equations

Use display math blocks for numbered equations

Assign identifiers where referenced:

$$
H(t) = \int_0^t h(s)\,ds
$$ {#eq:cumhaz}

4.2 Referencing

Refer using: Eq. (@eq:cumhaz) or Equation (@eq:cumhaz)

Do not hard-code equation numbers

5. Citations & References
5.1 Citation style

Journal target: Statistics in Medicine (SIM)

Citation style: AMA

CSL file: american-medical-association.csl

5.2 In-text citations

Numeric, superscript

Order of appearance

Multiple citations: ¹–³ or ¹,²,⁴

5.3 Reference list

Auto-generated by Pandoc

No manual numbering

Journal abbreviations per Chemical Abstracts / PubMed conventions

6. Terminology Conventions (LOCKED)
6.1 Frailty-related terms
Conceptual role	| Approved term	| Usage
Process	Frailty normalization	Section headers, algorithm steps
Result	Depletion-neutralized	Adjective for hazards, KCOR
Model	Gamma-frailty model / fit	Technical description only

Prohibited as primary terms:

“frailty neutralization” (noun phrase)

“gamma-frailty inversion” (headline term)

6.2 Outcome terminology

Generic term: event

Timing: event date or event time

Use “death” only when discussing mortality explicitly

6.3 Exposure terminology

Generic term: intervention count

COVID-specific: dose (allowed in examples only)

6.4 Defined terms

- *Near-flat*: Italicize on first use; defined operationally as median KCOR(t) within ±5% of unity over the diagnostic window
- **Quiet window**: Use consistently (hyphenated as compound modifier only, e.g., "quiet-window procedure"); avoid "quiet period" unless explicitly synonymous

7. Style & Tone

First-person plural ("we") is acceptable for methodological descriptions

No rhetorical questions

No policy advocacy language

Methods-first framing

Explicit limits and assumptions

8. Sections & Structure

Methods sections may be long and technical

Assumptions must be explicit and centralized (§2.1.1)

Validation must include:

- Negative controls
- Positive controls
- Diagnostics

8.1 Required statements

The following must appear in the manuscript:

- "does not estimate instantaneous hazard ratios" (Discussion §4.1)
- "not a substitute for randomization" (Limitations §5)
- Explicit causal interpretation caveat

9. Supplements

Supplementary material is allowed and encouraged

Supplement is not included in word count

Figures and tables in the supplement must be numbered separately

10. Change Control

Any change that:

introduces new terminology,

alters numbering behavior,

or changes citation style

must first update this STYLE_GUIDE.md.
