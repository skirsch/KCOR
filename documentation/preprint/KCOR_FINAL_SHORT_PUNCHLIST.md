# KCOR Paper – Final Short Punchlist (Optional Polish Only)

This is a **short, low-risk punchlist** based on recent feedback review.
All items below are **optional** and intended only for minor clarity or reviewer-proofing.
No methodological changes are required.

---

## 1. Quiet window clarification (optional, 1 sentence)

**Where:** §2.5 (Quiet period selection)

**Add (one sentence):**
> “Quiet periods are identified diagnostically via stability of observed cumulative hazards and absence of external shocks, rather than by a fixed universal numeric threshold.”

---

## 2. Identifiability signpost (optional, 1 sentence)

**Where:** §2.6 (Gamma-frailty parameter estimation)

**Add (one sentence):**
> “In practice, lack of identifiable curvature naturally manifests as θ̂ → 0, providing an internal diagnostic for non-identifiability over short or sparse follow-up.”

---

## 3. Skip-weeks rationale signpost (optional, 1 sentence)

**Where:** §2.7 (Dynamic HVE handling)

**Add (one sentence):**
> “The skip-weeks parameter is prespecified and evaluated via sensitivity analysis to exclude early enrollment instability rather than to tune estimates.”

---

## 4. Schematic figure disclaimer (if not already present)

**Where:** Figure 1 caption

**Ensure inclusion of:**
> “This figure is schematic and intended for conceptual illustration; it does not represent empirical data.”

---

## 5. Terminology consistency (optional, global)

**Action:**
Prefer the phrase:
- “selection-induced depletion curvature”

over looser alternatives when curvature is explicitly meant.

---

## 6. KCOR versioning (no change recommended)

**Action:**
- Keep “KCOR” as the primary name
- Allow “v6” only where implementation details are discussed

No edits required unless desired stylistically.

---

## Explicitly do NOT change

- Do not add new simulations
- Do not expand causal claims
- Do not add comparisons to unrelated causal frameworks
- Do not remove validation figures or controls

---

## Status

- Methodology: **complete**
- Validation: **complete**
- Documentation: **submission-ready**
- Remaining work: **cosmetic only**
