# KCOR – Final Micro Punchlist: Minimal Data Requirements (Exact Text Additions)

This punchlist adds **one high-impact feature** that differentiates KCOR from most observational methods:
**its minimal data requirements**.  
Both additions are low-risk, exact-text insertions.

---

## 1. Abstract: Explicitly state minimal data requirements

**Why:**  
This is a major advantage of KCOR and should be visible immediately to readers.

**Location:**  
Abstract (near the end, after method description and before validation claims).

**Exact sentence to add:**
> “KCOR requires only event timing—dates of intervention (enrollment) and dates of death (with birth date or year needed only for age stratification)—making it applicable to minimal record-level mortality datasets.”

---

## 2. Methods: Clarify required inputs explicitly

**Why:**  
Reinforces the abstract claim and prevents reviewer confusion about hidden covariate needs.

**Location:**  
Methods section, at first description of data inputs or cohort construction.

**Exact sentence to add:**
> “Required inputs are minimal: for each individual, the intervention or enrollment date(s) and the date of death, with birth date or year included only if age stratification is performed.”

## Explicitly do NOT add

- Do not introduce covariates or adjustment variables
- Do not imply availability of comorbidities
- Do not suggest causal identification from minimal data
- Do not expand the abstract beyond one sentence

## Status after applying this punchlist

- Key differentiator: **explicitly surfaced**
- Abstract strength: **significantly improved**
- Reviewer confusion risk: **reduced**
- Scope integrity: **unchanged**
