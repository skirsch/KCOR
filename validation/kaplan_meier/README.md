### Kaplan-Meier Validation

This directory will contain a traditional Kaplan–Meier survival analysis to validate KCOR results.

- Purpose: Provide a non-parametric benchmark of survival/incidence over time.
- Inputs: Cohort-level or individual-level event/censor data (to be specified).
- Outputs: Survival curves, confidence intervals, and comparisons vs KCOR-derived metrics.

Planned contents:
- `km_analysis.py`: Core Kaplan–Meier fitting and plotting
- `examples/`: Example datasets and usage scripts
- `out/`: Generated figures and tables

Implementation to follow.
