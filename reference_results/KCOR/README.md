There are 3 main output files from the KCOR analysis

- KCORv4.xlsx: this is the file with the dose pairs sheet for plotting KCOR(t)
- KCOR_summary.xlsx: this just summarizes the final results at the end of 2022 for each cohort
- KCOR_summary.log: this is a text file log produced when we run KCOR.py
