### reference directory for negative control tests

Note that the "1950" data is from unvaccinated (various age groups) so should be more reliable as a negative control test.

1940 is from vaccinated

1960 is from all people regardless of vaccination status.

The synthetic_negative_control.xlsx file is the input file to KCOR with the negative control mappings.

The processed file is the output.

The analysis file is the analysis which references the processed neg control file copied into this directory.

See the README in the test/negative_control directory for more details.
