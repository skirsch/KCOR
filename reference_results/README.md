## Reference results

These are files that were created on earlier runs. 
Any new code should return the same values for the same parameters.

The files in this directory are moved over manually.

There are two directories

- KCOR: has outputs from the KCOR.py analysis
- analysis: has files created by hand analysis of the files above, e.g., adding pivot table/plotting in Excel. The KCORv3 and KCORv2 spreadsheets have a lot of such analysis including naturally matched cohorts in KCORv2.
