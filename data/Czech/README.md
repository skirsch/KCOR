### data/Czech directory

This directory contains the original Czech dataset (gzip compressed).

It also has the output files from the make scripts.

Analysis is in Excel and it uses data connections to these files.

The main xlsx output files are the CMR (fixed cohorts; the input to KCOR), KCOR (the main KCOR output), and variable (variable cohorts for other analysis like GLM).
