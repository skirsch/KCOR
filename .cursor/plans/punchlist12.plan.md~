name: Punchlist12 notation invariants
overview: "Mechanically enforce the non-negotiable notation/estimand invariants from `punchlist12_jlw_feedback.md` across the manuscript, in two passes: (1) produce a structured violation report (no edits), then (2) apply only the minimal notation fixes after approval."
todos:
  - id: scan-paper-md
    content: Scan `documentation/preprint/paper.md` for notation/estimand invariant violations per `punchlist12_jlw_feedback.md`, covering all categories (hazards, indices, hats/tildes, gamma-frailty identity, baseline form, KCOR vs KCOR(t), display-math requirements, internal isomorphism).
    status: pending
  - id: produce-violation-report
    content: Produce the Phase 1 structured violation report with exact locations, current snippet, violation type, canonical target form, and minimal mechanical replacement guidance (no manuscript edits).
    status: pending
    dependencies:
      - scan-paper-md
  - id: apply-approved-fixes
    content: After user approval, apply only the minimal mechanical edits to `documentation/preprint/paper.md` to enforce all invariants, ensuring composite expressions remain in display math and meaning is unchanged.

# Punchlist 12 — Notation/Estimand Invariants Enforcement Plan

## Scope and constraints

- **In-scope file**: [`documentation/preprint/paper.md`](documentation/preprint/paper.md)
- **Rules source of truth**: [`documentation/preprint/punchlist12_instructions.md`](documentation/preprint/punchlist12_instructions.md) and [`documentation/preprint/punchlist12_jlw_feedback.md`](documentation/preprint/punchlist12_jlw_feedback.md)
- **Hard constraints** (mechanical enforcement only):
- Do **not** change scientific meaning.
- Do **not** introduce new symbols or simplify notation.
- Do **not** inline composite expressions; use **display math** for tilde/hats/multi-subscripts.
- Do **not** convert display math into inline math.

## Phase 1 (required first): build plan / violation report (no edits)

Produce a structured list of violations with file locations in `paper.md`, grouped by invariant category. Each entry should include:

- **Location**: section heading + nearby unique text (and line numbers if available)
- **Current form**: the exact math/prose snippet
- **Violation type**: which rule(s) it breaks
- **Canonical target form**: exactly matching the canonical forms in `punchlist12_jlw_feedback.md`
- **Minimal mechanical fix**: what to replace, without altering surrounding prose unless required

### Violation categories to scan for (mechanically)

- **Cumulative hazard notation stability**
- Ensure the three distinct objects are consistently notated with explicit cohort index:
    - $$H_{\mathrm{obs},d}(t),\qquad H_{0,d}(t),\qquad \tilde{H}_{0,d}(t)$$
- Remove disallowed observational superscripts (e.g., $$H_d^{\mathrm{obs}}(t)$$).
- **Index placement invariance**
- Cohort index must stay attached to the same symbol in the same position everywhere.
- No “context-carries-index” usages.
- **Parameters vs. estimates discipline**
- Conceptual parameters: $$\theta_d,\qquad k_d$$ (no hats)
- Quiet-window fitted estimates: $$\hat{\theta}_d,\qquad \hat{k}_d$$
- Never alternate hats/unhatted for the same fitted quantity; never drop cohort subscript.
- **Gamma-frailty identity canonicalization**
- Mixture identity must be exactly:
    - $$H_{\mathrm{obs},d}(t)=\frac{1}{\theta_d}\log\!\left(1+\theta_d\,H_{0,d}(t)\right)$$
- Inversion must be exactly:
    - $$H_{0,d}(t)=\frac{\exp\!\left(\theta_d\,H_{\mathrm{obs},d}(t)\right)-1}{\theta_d}$$
- Flag any algebraically-equivalent but visually different variants.
- **Quiet-window constant-baseline form**
- If assuming constant baseline over the fit window, enforce:
    - $$H_{0,d}(t)=k_d\,t$$
- Remove/flag auxiliary baseline-shape symbols introduced but unused.
- **Estimand vs framework naming**
- “KCOR” = framework; **estimand must be** $KCOR(t)$.
- Estimand definition must match:
    - $$KCOR(t)=\frac{\tilde{H}_{0,A}(t)}{\tilde{H}_{0,B}(t)}$$
- Flag any places where “KCOR” is used to mean the curve/value at time $t$.
- **Display math requirement for composite expressions**
- Any expression with hats/tilde/multi-subscripts (esp. $$\tilde{H}_{0,d}(t)$$, $$\hat{\theta}_d$$, etc.) must be in **display math**.
- Flag inline occurrences that must be converted to display math (without changing the math).
- **Notational isomorphism within `paper.md`**
- Methods, figure captions, appendices sections inside `paper.md` must use the same canonical symbols (no shorthand like $H_0$ unless explicitly defined identically and used consistently).

## Phase 2 (after approval): apply fixes (minimal mechanical edits)

Once you approve the Phase 1 report, apply edits to [`documentation/preprint/paper.md`](documentation/preprint/paper.md) only:

- Replace non-canonical symbols/placements with the canonical ones.
- Ensure all required composite expressions are in display math and none are demoted from display to inline.
- Preserve all cohort subscripts and observational/baseline/depletion-neutralized distinctions.
- Keep prose changes to the minimum necessary to avoid notational ambiguity.

## Acceptance criteria

- All occurrences in `paper.md` conform to the canonical forms and rules in `punchlist12_jlw_feedback.md`.
- No introduced new symbols; no meaning changes; no inlining of composite expressions.
